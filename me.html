            <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
            <P>My name is Trisha Agaba Esther. I am 20 years old. I am a Ugandan, to be specific, a Munyankole. I am a very beautiful, confident and independent woman with so much life in me. I have a very beautiful smile that you can't fail to see when you meet me. It's a smile that would brighten your day and completely change your mood. I am very loving and charming with eyes for days. I am currently doing software engineering at Makerere University which I love so much. I think choosing this course was one of the best decisions I made and i don't regret any secong of it. I am very Godfearing. I believe in the existence of a higher power and I think this world is a beautiful place and life is a beautiful thing that we take for granted. <br>My course is a four year course whereby I've only moved about a quarter into it. We learn different coding languages such as Java, Javascript, C++ among others. My course requires a lot of concentration and dedication whereby you have to read ahead of the lecturer if your goal is to ace the course.</P>
